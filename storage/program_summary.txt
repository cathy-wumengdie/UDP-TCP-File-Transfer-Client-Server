In this program, the client will download a file from the server over the network using sockets.
This program uses a two-stage communication process. In the negotiation stage, the client
and the server negotiate through a fixed negotiation port (<n_port>) of the server, a random
port (<r_port>) for later use. Later in the transaction stage, the client and the server connect
through the selected random port (<r_port>) for actual file transfer.
Requests and responses in this program will mimic the negotiation and transaction stage
procedures of File Transfer Protocol (FTP). This protocol will have a GET command for
downloading files. In FTP a GET request can be executed in active mode, the “default” mode, or
passive mode (PASV).
In the negotiation phase, the client issues a GET command to the server indicating a file name
(<filename>) and either a client-side port number (<r_port>) or the code PASV. This will
determine whether, in the transaction stage, the server should connect to the client on
<r_port> and push the file to the client or the client should connect to the server on the port
number <r_port> returned by the server in response to a passive GET request to receive the
file.
